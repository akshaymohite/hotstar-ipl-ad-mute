![HOTSTAR IPL AD Muter](chrome/128.png?raw=true) 
# Hotstar Ad Muter

This tiny browser extension auto mutes certain ads in live sport streams on Hotstar like IPL by intercepting Hotstar's ad tracking pixels. It also dynamically determines how long to mute by guessing the duration of the ad from the ad identifier.

Provides respite to your ears by muting the following ads out of the box.

## Caveats
- Sometimes broadcasters try to squeeze in one more ad before the next over begins. If the ad gets cut short abruptly, the live action may stay muted for a few extra seconds before the extension unmutes the tab
- This extension may break if Hotstar change their current tracking pixel URLs or change the format or keywords used in their ad identifiers
